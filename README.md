# What is Forkpack

Forkpack is a modpack with many fun and preformance enhancing mods included. Forkpack also has a Server Edition which removes rendering mods to ensure compatibility and preformance.

## Mods Included

Forkpack is a modpack which adds a few mods including Create and Create: Steam n' Rails. But, to keep the game running well, Forkpack also adds preformace improvement mods to make sure the game is running smoothly. 

## Preformance

The popular Sodium and Lithium mods are used to improve preformance in this modpack. Vannila Minecraft struggles to keep a good framerate because of lag spikes, memory issues, game logic issues, and rendering bugs. Meanwhile, even with  some mods that add preformance overhead, Sodium and Lithuim are able to keep this modpack running well, because of opimiztions of the games code.
